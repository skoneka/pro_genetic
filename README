A group project for 2011/2012 course in Algorithms and Data Structures.
The task consisted of implementing a genetic algorithm for finding a
best layout of seats in a bus. Part of the assignment was visualization
of results. The project should be perhaps called "Bus Layout Evaluator
and Viewer".

Even that it was a group project, we ended up implementing two completely
distinct prototypes.  Obviously, at the beginning, we failed to divide
and conquer and had to do much more work. But then we made a comparison
of our approaches and ended up finishing really well.

Prototype 1 ( by Tomasz Sobutka ) with breadth-first search
(BFS). Java + Swing

Prototype 2 ( by Artur Skonecki ) with circle packing.
Python 2.5 + PyGame 1.7.1
